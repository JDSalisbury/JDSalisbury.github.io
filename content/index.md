# Welcome to My Digital Garden ğŸŒ±

Hello there! This is me, Jeff, and welcome to my digital garden.

This space is a curated archive of my study notes, research, and hands-on explorations in **LLMs/AI** and **Cloud Platforms** like AWS, Azure, and beyond. Itâ€™s a living repository where I document what I learn, break things apart, and put them back togetherâ€”sometimes better, sometimes just to understand them more deeply.

## My Areas of Interest ğŸš€

- **Large Language Models & AI** â€“ Experimenting with LLM architectures, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning models.
- **Cloud Computing** â€“ Exploring AWS, Azure, and the modern cloud ecosystem for scalable applications.
- **DevOps & Automation** â€“ Streamlining deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.
- **Backend Engineering** â€“ Architecting robust, scalable web applications and APIs.

This digital garden is my evolving map of knowledgeâ€”structured, scattered, and always growing. Feel free to explore! ğŸŒ¿

> _P.S. There might be a hidden corner of this site where I document my more creative side. Happy hunting!_ ğŸ‘€
